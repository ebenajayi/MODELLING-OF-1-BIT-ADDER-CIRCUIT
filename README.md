# MODELLING-OF-1-BIT-ADDER-CIRCUIT
The program for modelling of a 1-bit adder circuit using JESS has been written and made available in appendix A1 stored as Adder_CCT_Modelling .clp file. The device has 3 inputs namely, “IN_A”, “IN_B” and “Carry_in” respectively and 2 outputs labeled as “Sum bit” and “C-out” respectively.
