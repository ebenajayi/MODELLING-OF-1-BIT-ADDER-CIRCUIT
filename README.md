# MODELLING-OF-1-BIT-ADDER-CIRCUIT AND FAULT DIAGNOSIS
The program for modeling of a 1-bit adder circuit using JESS has been written and made available and stored as Adder_CCT_Modelling .clp file. The device has 3 inputs namely, “IN_A”, “IN_B” and “Carry_in” respectively and 2 outputs labeled as “Sum bit” and “C-out” respectively. Also, a code is written with the aim of detecting if there is(are) fault in the adder circuit when a set of inputs together with what the desired outputs should be are inputted into the system. For example, if the inputs to the adder are 0, 1 with a carry of 0, the output should be 1 with a carryout of 0.
